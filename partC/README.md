# Assignment 2: Part C: Using a pre-trained model
----------------------------------------------------
Here we use a pre-trained YoloV3 model and use it in an application of our choice.<nr/>

# Real Time Wildlife Educator for Children #
----------------------------------------------
Our application is focussed on educating children while making it self engaging to learn.<br/>
Our application can be used in a sanctuary to identify animals and educate the children with various interesting facts about the same. It can also be used to teach children in school. The application uses a pre-trained YoloV3 model. It takes as input a 3 second video of an animal and detects the object to be that animal which has been classified majority of the duration in the 3 second video to narrate fun facts about the animal. Currently, the application can detect bears, elephants, giraffe, horse, zebra, bird, cat, dog, sheep and cow.
