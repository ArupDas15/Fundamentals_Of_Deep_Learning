# Description:

This repository contains the solutions to all the assignments that were done as part of enhancing the learning experience in the **CS6910: Fundamentals of Deep Learning** course offered by Indian Institute of Technology Madras. The course was taught by [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/).

1. In the [first assignment](https://github.com/ArupDas15/Fundamentals_Of_Deep_Learning/tree/master/cs6910_assignment1) we create a neural network model and implement the variants of gradient descent from scratch.
2. In the [second assignment](https://github.com/ArupDas15/Fundamentals_Of_Deep_Learning/tree/master/cs6910_assignment2) we train a CNN model from scratch.
3. In the [third assingment](https://github.com/ArupDas15/Fundamentals_Of_Deep_Learning/tree/master/cs6910_assignment3) we create a transliteration system using RNN.
