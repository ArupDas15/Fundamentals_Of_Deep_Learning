In this [assignment](https://wandb.ai/miteshk/assignments/reports/Assignment-2--Vmlldzo0NjA1MTU) we </br></br>
(i) Train a CNN model from scratch and learn how to tune the hyperparameters and visualise filters ( [Click here to know more](https://github.com/ArupDas15/Fundamentals_Of_Deep_Learning/tree/master/cs6910_assignment2/partA/README.md) ).</br>
(ii) Finetune a pre-trained model just as you would do in many real world applications ( [Click here to know more](https://github.com/ArupDas15/Fundamentals_Of_Deep_Learning/tree/master/cs6910_assignment2/partB/README.md) ).</br>
(iii) Use an existing pre-trained model for a cool application. ( [Click here to know more](https://github.com/ArupDas15/Fundamentals_Of_Deep_Learning/tree/master/cs6910_assignment2/partC/README.md) ). </br></br>
