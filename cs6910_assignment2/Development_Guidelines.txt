This file is created to follow good software engineering practices for the development of the project.

Guidelines to be followed during development.
----------------------------------------------
1. Comments to be written before the action is to be taken.
   For e.g. #initialising a to 0
            a=0
   The comment can also be written beside the action provided the comment is not too long.
2. Debug code to not be present in the master branch.
3. Code of collaborator to be viewed only when pull request is made to avoid any confusions that may arise.
4. Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
   Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
   More Details over here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#:~:text=%2Dpublic%22).-,Function%20and%20Variable%20Names,same%20convention%20as%20function%20names.
5. Create pull requests before merging changes to master branch where every pull request should be made with sufficient evidence regarding the correctness of the modified code.
6. Follow pair programming approach to implement critical algorithms.
